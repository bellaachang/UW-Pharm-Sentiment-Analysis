So, I know what I need to improve, and questioning myself some questions like what are my weaknesses/strengths? what are my goals/purposes? why should I feel proud of myself?Write a letter to my future self: who I want to become, what I want to accomplish. What are the challenges that I want to overcome in the next week/month/year? What lessons that I want to give advice for my younger self and future self?
