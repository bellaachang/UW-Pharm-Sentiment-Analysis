That is the beautiful thing about living in Washington, there is so much green year-round, and even going for a drive outside the city to see nature gives me peace. I bought a small plant at Trader Joe’s and seeing the color green in my apartment lifts my spirits. So, I thought to myself, I need to get more greenery!

31,,"I’m questioning myself How am I feeling? What does the feeling come from? I am feeling low today. Maybe it’s depression, maybe I am just feeling sad and lonely. Either way, I am not feeling like my best self. Sometimes, I feel like being human is so hard; especially, being emotional unstable is such a challenge for me to handle. I know these negative feelings are just temporary, and I am aware that these negative energies will go away soon. But I really need time to process these emotions. I recognize the feeling of sadness and loneliness, so I need to face with these roller-coaster feelings. Thus, I am able to learn how to accept them, and it turns out easier for me to move on.  To be frank, it seems like it’s quite difficult for me to express my emotions. Nobody truly understands what I’m feeling or I’m thinking. Therefore, I think I need a little pause from life. I keep reminding myself that true healing occurs when I give myself permission to feel whatever feelings live below the triggers. I should choose to focus on what brings me happiness. I invite something nicer to come up and calm the negative energies. I read some inspiring words. I listen to a piece of beautiful music. I go somewhere in nature or I do some walking meditation. These activities help me to boost up my energy and bring me joy. I believe that I gradually feel better soon. ",Emotional,,Emotional,Environmental,Emotional,Environmental
