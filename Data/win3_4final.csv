The book was rather short and was not my favorite by any means, but it was engaging enough that I finished it. It was a nice mental break to just be fully lost in a story for awhile rather then focusing on stressors. I love to books and that love has been put on the sidelines by school, and it was great to reignite that passion.  I don't have time to do it all that much, but it was truly great to read just for the sake of reading and was a good way to relax. ",Mental,,Mental,,Mental,

27,,"Today, I decided to cook a meal, and I made a mushroom-cheese egg scramble, topped with green salsa. It only took 10 minutes to make (maybe less), but since I still have a lot of studying to do today, it was a good idea to have a meal to hold me through the rest of the afternoon. Usually for breakfast, I have coffee and lots of water. It was nice to be able to have a meal before sitting down to continue with school work.  I enjoy cooking and spending time in the kitchen. At the moment, school has been taking up a lot of my time, and my stress levels have significantly increased. This is affecting me a lot because I can feel my anxiety getting out of control, to the point where cooking is also becoming stressful. Spending more than half hour in the kitchen to clean and cook is not an option because there is so much studying and homework to be done. During the day I have to remind myself that it is ok to take a meal break. My first meal is usually sometime after noon.

Today, the activity that I would like to choose is nurture connection; specifically, self-connectedness. 
Firstly, I want to have a vision board which contains all my dreams and goals that I want to achieve in the next 4 years (2025- the year I will graduate from pharmacy school).  
Secondly, I will write a future letter for myself in 2025. In the letter, When I write this letter, I pretend that I already achieved all things I wish when I was young. For example, I will say that I am so proud of myself because I already finished the pharmacy school, now I’m officially become a real pharmacist which is a significant milestone in my career and my life. 
Thirdly, reflect on my journey. I will make a comparison between the reality (2025) and my vision board to see how much different. Writing down all the reason why I do not achieve the goal, what I do to successfully accomplish my dreams. Hopefully, I can achieve 90% of all things I sketch in my vision board.
