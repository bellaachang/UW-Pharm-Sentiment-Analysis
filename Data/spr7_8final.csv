I was having anxiety about coming home because the family drama kept piling on, and it was even causing me to lose sleep over the past 2 weeks. Yet, I am such a lucky human to have friends who keep me sane and know how to reel me back in. Today’s story is about my amazing friend [name] and how he saves me every time I am in town. In November of last year, he took me to art therapy during a time when my soul was feeling unrest. This time around, he picked me up from O’Hare airport, took me out for chicken and waffles (he paid), drove me to my parent’s house, hauled my luggage inside their house, played with my dog, and had a nice visit with my mom. First and foremost, no one likes going to O’Hare, especially in the middle of the day, and he was happy to do it. Second, he doesn’t like to keep me waiting, so he was there early even though my flight was delayed. Third, chicken and waffles! Being able to spend the day with such an amazing friend gave me a wonderful and happy start to a very exhausting upcoming week. We didn’t talk about family, school, nor work. We just laughed a lot, and to be honest, that is all I needed. I am super lucky to have a friend like him. [photo of student and friend with caption: We love to go on walks.

31,,"I just want to be me. Be yourself: behave in a natural way, rather than trying to pretend to be different. Personality contains a variety of aspects. Personal values or authentic self. People respect those who are authentic to who they are. I spend most of my time alone a lot. Knowing who you are simply puts you in a position to make choices that complement your preferences.You are a beautifully unique, complex individual with many different aspects to your personality. Ask yourself: which is the coolest and kindest version of myself to be right now?Start a journey of finding myself.I lost myself for too long. I do not take good care of myself, I changed myself in negative way; that was too bad. I miss the old Linh. The old Linh that used to work so hard, full of ambition with goals and plans, dedicate all my time to study. The old [student name] that used to be really happy and innocent. Starting this year, I will spend time to understand myself, take good care of myself, love myself more than anything else, myself is always the top priority.How to find myself? love myself by listening to my heart, know what is right for me, spend time and make effort to take good care of my skin, my health, my body, my brain, my hair, my emotion, my knowledge, my own vibe, my fashion style; create my own personality and character that I wish to become.
