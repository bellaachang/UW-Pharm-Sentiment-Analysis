27,,"Our PY1 year is coming to an end and I have a lot to be grateful for. I’m grateful for the sunshine, even on cloudy days, because I know the sun is still there. I am grateful for my apartment because it has come a long way from the days with an air mattress on the floor and a cardboard box table. The following are my top 5 things I am grateful for:
1. I am grateful that my parents are being extremely supportive. This was not the case at first because it was hard for them to have me so far away. Yet, with time they have come see how happy I am here in Washington, and that means the world to them. There are some days that my mom still struggles and misses me a lot, but then I ask her to come live here with me for a couple of weeks, and she decides she can wait until I come home again to visit. 
2. I am grateful for my friends, new and old. I have made amazing friends at school and outside of school that are also supportive, kind, and caring.
3. I am grateful that I have amazing professors who are understanding and compassionate. Some things have been challenging since I have moved to Seattle. The loss of my aunt in November, feeling alone and overwhelmed at time when I go back to Chicago, my mother’s health being unpredictable, the crazy demands of a Mexican federal and local government, my extended family falling apart due to changes my grams made to her will before she past away, Steven’s mental health, and my own mental health. So yes, I am so ever grateful to my professors for helping me get through all these things. And I am determined to one day move back to Chicago, and have a new sense of normal that does not involve so much drama.
4. I am grateful for the mountains that I get to see everyday because they lift me and make me smile.
5. Lastly, I am grateful for the amazing experiences and opportunities that I get to live everyday.",Emotional,,Emotional,,Emotional,

Walking outside today gives me the feeling of peaceful mind and inner calm. I truly appreciate and enjoy this moment. 
I would like to spend few minutes in silence, not to do anything, just feel the present, feel the nature, feel my true self. It is such a healing time for me. 
After that, I feel so much better and refresh, inspire me to be more creative and work harder, and feel more grateful about my life. ",Environmental,Physical,Environmental,Emotional,Environmental,Physical
