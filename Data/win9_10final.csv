27,,"For self-care, this week I organized my apartment (it’s a studio so it’s not so much) and it felt great! There is this calming feeling when my surroundings are organized, it makes me happy, and it motivates me to study more. I did laundry and made sure everything was clean and hung in its respective place; my clothes are organized by color, it flows nicely and it’s pretty to look at, plus I know where everything is and it takes me less time to pick something to wear. I folded sweaters, stored shoes that I don’t wear often and left out the ones that I wear the most for school and work. This also helps because I have the minimum number of shoes available, which means less time spent looking for shoes. But, the one thing that made me really happy was rearranging my furniture. I feel like I tend to do this a lot, after a while something starts to feel off about the apartment, I move the furniture, and then everything is well in my world again. I kept thinking about my mom because we would help her rearrange the furniture as kids, and we did it quite often. I get it now. Been meaning to tell her that. My apartment is organized, but in my head, it’s not fully organized, so I am always looking for ways to improve things. For spring break, my plan is to organize the kitchen, put up some curtains, bring in some green plants, and scrub the kitchen floors (I sweep and clean but it feels like it needs a good scrubbing). It’s definitely not a trip to Cabo, but I know it’s going to make me so happy. ",Environmental,,Environmental,Mental,Environmental,
