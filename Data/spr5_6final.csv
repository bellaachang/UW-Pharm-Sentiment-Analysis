When we first started keeping track of wellness activities, I had just begun going to therapy. I went every week, and then every other week and now I am down to as needed because in a lot of ways my mental health has improved since the beginning of Winter quarter. Unfortunately constant anxiety has cropped up as a new symptom in the past few weeks and I'm thinking I may need more support than just talk therapy. My mom is on an insurance plan through her work and since I am still included on her insurance, I thankfully have access to some free psychiatry and life-coach resources. I took time to research those options and am currently finding time in my schedule to set up a session",Emotional,,Emotional,Mental,Emotional,Mental

27,,"For my health and wellness this week I took myself out for tacos. I know it doesn’t sound very exciting, but it just made my day. I haven’t had tacos in quite a while so I was way overdue. The place I go to is in Everett and it just fills me with beautiful memories. It is the first place my dad and I ate when we arrived to the Seattle area at the end of July 2021 (my dad drove with me from Chicago to Washington, then he flew back home). Food is comfort for us. Being somewhere new and so far away from home, it just made us so happy to have found a good taco place when we arrived. I always facetime my parents to show them my tacos! So, I guess it is more than tacos, it just makes me remember all the great memories that I made with my dad during our 4-day long road trip. Also, it reminds me how grateful I am to be where I am at today. Also, the fact that I can find the taco place without GPS is a win in my book! So yeah, tacos. Good stuff.

I review their profiles and really admire their works. They have achieved so many goals in their professional career. I also question myself how can they are so productive and passionate about things they do? What motivation to keep them going and working that hard? How can I connect with these people? so I can learn from them. Exploring a variety of profiles from different backgrounds and occupations truly inspires me to work harder, study harder, and I want to contribute my work, knowledge, and skills to the world. ",Occupational,,Occupational,Community,Occupational,Community
