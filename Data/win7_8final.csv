12,,"I went hiking with a good friend of mine and my dog.  We hiked up a trail that is commonly used for cross country skiing and snowshoeing.  The snow was compact enough that we did not need snowshoes though.  We hiked up about four miles with sleds, looking like lunatics, and then sledded all the way down.  It was ridiculously fun, sledding down four miles, we were giggling like kids the whole way. It was a really nice break.",Physical,Environmental,Community,Environmental,Physical,Community

I also do a lot of self-care in the form of skincare and I want to start doing more hair care. When I take care of myself physically in these forms I feel more put together and generally better about myself. Walking is another way I can physically help myself. I think doing these physical activities like walking, skincare, and hair care reflect onto my mental health as well in a positive manner! I also wanted to thank the 512 teaching team for doing this wellness self-care documentation. It reminds me to take care of myself and take a break from studying or stressing!

During the hour for ‘Me’ time, I called home to check in on mom. She was happy because her sister was there and they were making cream of broccoli soup. I miss her and my dog too. At the same time, I made myself breakfast, something easy and fast that reminds me of my childhood. Eggs cooked with sliced wieners. And then you put ketchup on top. Chicago people take very much offense to putting ketchup on hotdogs, but they just don’t know what they are missing. After that, I made my bed and organized the kitchen. Then, I realized that self-care means the most basic care for living (food, clean, wash clothes, etc.). It made me laugh at myself, but at this point I will take what I can get, and I am super grateful to have had that hour because I feel mentally awake and ready to go about the rest of my day.

I got personal satisfaction after trying a new recipe. I feel healed and rewarded after enjoying my meal. Cooking a new dinner dish this time enabled me to create something I have not taken the opportunity to do; and figured out myself that I could manage things in my control like how much seasoning should I add in, check the temperature, the time to cook.
