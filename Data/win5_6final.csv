It was such a therapeutic to clear my mind and force me to enjoy the weather, the wind, the street, the random people walking. Suddenly, I feel so blessed. I feel blessed that I’m still breathing normally. I feel myself privileged to have a healthy body that I can use for school and work. And I had so many questions came up. How do I see the world when I’m no longer connected? How does the world see me? Then comes the biggest lesson: how the world sees me is how I see myself. And here I am… flawed, out of focus, waiting to be colored all over. As long as there’s light, I want to reflect.",Physical,Emotional,Mental,Spiritual,Physical,Emotional
