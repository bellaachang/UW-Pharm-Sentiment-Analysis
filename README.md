# UW-Pharm-Sentiment-Analysis

I am collaborating with UW Pharmacy in a comprehensive assessment of student reflections integrated into a pioneering mandatory self-care curriculum. The initiative aims to gauge the impact of dedicated self-care practices within the educational framework.

Students were tasked with allocating one hour per day, once a week, to engage in a self-care activity chosen from diverse categories encompassing Physical, Mental, Spiritual, Community, Occupational, and Emotional domains. The selection process was guided by the highly regarded [Princeton UMatter self-assessment framework](https://umatter.princeton.edu/sites/g/files/toruqf2181/files/media/princeton-umatter-wellness-self-assessment.pdf), acknowledged as the prevailing model in the field.

Quarterly reflections from over 150 students were meticulously managed and organized in collaboration with UW Pharmacy associate professors. The objective was to systematically categorize student comments according to predefined criteria. 

Two parts of this project:
1. Basic sentiment analysis (complete)
   
Utilizing VADER sentiment analysis and the NLTK Python library, I have so far quantified the tonal nuances and emotional undercurrents present in the reflections. Leveraging text parsing and SpaCy, a specialized NLP library adept in part-of-speech tagging, I identified prevailing verbs and nouns within each distinct self-care category.
The culmination of this data analysis can be found in a presentation at the American College of Clinical Pharmacy conference held in Colorado in July 2023, wherein the results and insights garnered from this study were shared with the national academic community.

2. Finding themes in student sentiment (current)
   
Current research is looking at ways to find themes in student sentiment by building a model utilizing LDA and/or topic classification.

Data and code is limited for student privacy. Official presentation available only. Ongoing research project.
