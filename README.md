# UW-Pharm-Sentiment-Analysis
In June 2023, I worked with UW Pharmacy in evaluating their student reflections to the incorporation of a mandatory self-care practice in their curriculum. This beta curriculum was conducted in the winter and spring quarters of 2022 and 2023 and the results of this data analysis were presented in a national pharmacy conference in Dallas in July 2023.

This curriculum called for students to choose a self-care practice for 1 hour a day, once a week, from the following categories: Physical, Mental, Spiritual, Community, Mental, Occupational, and Emotional. Students were then asked to write reflections each quarter on: 1) what activity they chose, and 2) how they felt afterwards -- both about the activity and about themselves.

In this project, I worked with UW Pharmacy associate professors LeighAnn Mike and Jennifer Chang to organize the 150+ student reflections on the beta curriculum per quarter and categorize all comments according to a decided standard format. This analysis would be used to supplement their research on student well-being in education.

In this project, I used VADER sentiment analysis on all reflections and the NLP Python library package NLTK to quantify the tone and moods for this beta curriculum. I also used these packages to find common verbs and nouns within each category through text parsing and SpaCy, another NLP library trained for part-of-speech tagging.
