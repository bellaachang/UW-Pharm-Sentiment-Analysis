# UW-Pharm-Sentiment-Analysis
During the winter and spring quarters of 2022 and 2023, I collaborated with UW Pharmacy in a comprehensive assessment of student reflections integrated into a pioneering mandatory self-care curriculum. The initiative aimed to gauge the impact of dedicated self-care practices within the educational framework.

Students were tasked with allocating one hour per day, once a week, to engage in a self-care activity chosen from diverse categories encompassing Physical, Mental, Spiritual, Community, Occupational, and Emotional domains. The selection process was guided by the highly regarded [Princeton UMatter self-assessment framework](https://umatter.princeton.edu/sites/g/files/toruqf2181/files/media/princeton-umatter-wellness-self-assessment.pdf), acknowledged as the prevailing model in the field.

Quarterly reflections from over 150 students were meticulously managed and organized in collaboration with UW Pharmacy associate professors LeighAnn Mike and Jennifer Chang. The objective was to systematically categorize student comments according to predefined criteria, crucial in complementing ongoing research on student well-being in educational settings.

My role extended to employing sophisticated computational methods. Utilizing VADER sentiment analysis and the NLTK Python library, I quantified the tonal nuances and emotional undercurrents present in the reflections. Furthermore, leveraging text parsing and SpaCy, a specialized NLP library adept in part-of-speech tagging, I identified prevailing verbs and nouns within each distinct self-care category. These analytical methodologies contributed significantly to the comprehensive understanding of student experiences and perceptions regarding the beta curriculum.

The culmination of this rigorous data analysis culminated in a presentation at the esteemed American College of Clinical Pharmacy conference held in Colorado in July 2023, wherein the results and insights garnered from this study were shared with the national academic community.
